## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Position
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- In this project I learned how to combine CSS Flexbox, Grid and Position to achieve the required design.
- Moreover I also learned the mobile first design.

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  grid-template-areas:
    "header-image-left header-image-right"
    "header-text header-text";
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

### Continued development

- Moreover, I will learn ReactJS and bootstrap to make this design quickly.

### Useful resources

- [The Net Ninja's Mobile First course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hH1tAjyUPZPjbj-7s200a4) - This helped me for learning mobile first design method. I really liked the way that net ninja explain and I will apply it in my future projects.
